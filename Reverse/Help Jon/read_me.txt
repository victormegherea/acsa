Jon is testing security of company A and finds some files in intranet they look quite promising he wants to  see what   encrypted message.txt contains.
On further looking Jon  finds two interesting binaries:
- decryptor_for_message
- hide_key

On investigating Jon's conclusion is that hide key somehow contains the key needed for decryption the message.
Step 1:
-  Please help Jon to extract the secret key from hide_key


After finding the key Jon calls company A with his finding, and they are happy that Jon was the first to find about this and not the other hackers.

Step 2:
- The company A wants to see if its possible to hack the decryptor_for_messasge, and asked Jon to try to see if it's possible.Jon again needs your  help :D.

After the testing is done Jon needs to prepare a report for company A with detailed findings, and he needs to explain  why the encryption algorithm need to be changed ant to propose better code quality.
